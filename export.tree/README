# San Diego State University Traveling Subjects (SDSU-TS) Dataset

The San Diego State University Traveling Subjects (SDSU-TS) dataset was designed to facilitate the harmonization of MRI data acquired across autism neuroimaging studies conducted at San Diego State University (SDSU). The dataset includes MRI scans from 9 healthy adult participants (aged 22-55 years) collected at 2 imaging sites: SDSU Imaging Center (SDSU-MRI) and Center for Functional MRI, UC San Diego (CFMRI). Each participant was scanned at least once at both sites, with rescan data available for 5 participants at SDSU-MRI and 6 participants at CFMRI. The average interval between scan sessions within a participant was 7 days (range: 1-19 days).

The scan protocols we collected reflect those used in SDSU autism MRI studies over the last 10-15 years and include the following: 

- 5 diffusion-weighted (3 at CFMRI, 2 at SDSU-MRI)
- 3 T1-weighted (2 at CFMRI, 1 at SDSU-MRI)
- 2 T2-weighted (1 at each site)

Additionally, diffusion-weighted MRI protocols matching the publicly available Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) and Lifespan Human Connectome Project (HCP) studies were collected.

## Scan Protocols

The MRI protocols acquired at each site are shown below:

**Note:** 
- TE = Echo time (ms); TR = Repetition time (s); Res = spatial resolution.
- Reversed phase-encoding fieldmaps were acquired for all protocols.
- All data were acquired using a 32-channel head coil, except for the legacy sequences at CFMRI, which were acquired using an 8-channel head coil.

The unprocessed MRI data are provided along with anonymized participant demographic data.

The imaging data was converted to BIDS using ezBIDS ([https://brainlife.io/ezbids](https://brainlife.io/ezbids)) and custom scripts. All anatomical scans have been defaced using the Quickshear method in ezBIDS.

## Data Notes

Please note the following:

- The `1shell61dir` data in the `cfmri1` session of subjects `ts001`, `ts002`, and `ts004` were acquired with a variant spatial resolution (0.94x0.94mm instead of 1.875x1.875mm in-plane resolution).
- The `3shell45dir` data in the `cfmri1` session of subject `ts002` was acquired with a variant spatial resolution (2mm instead of 2.5mm slice thickness).
- The `1shell61dir` data in the `cfmri1` session of subject `ts010` was acquired with a variant TE (0.0843 instead of 0.0818s).
